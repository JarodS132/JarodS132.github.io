				<h2> run on sentences </h2>
		
				<p>I find <strong>run on sentences</strong> very interesting in that they never seem to end and keep going despite the fact that the creator should end it, but they do not want to even when in the context of the rest of the sentence it should clearly be multiple that are broken up but they are determined to continue writing with buts, ands, or other such ways to continue a sentence<strong>.</strong> Even when they do eventually use a period and give you a small <strong>glimpse</strong> of the hope of the end of their sentence and talking, they seem to fail the understand the lesson they just learned and the very next sentence they type or write continuing the pattern of its predecessor and once again fail to find a period for a longer length than should be humanly possible to consider a mistake and instead must be judged as a willful and intentional disregard for any English class that person who is typing or writing has taken, causing their English teachers to <strong>damn</strong> them for their lack of paying attention in class for all those years.</p>
